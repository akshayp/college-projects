    CONSOLE APPLICATION : MFCdllC Project Overview
========================================================================

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your MFCdllC application.


The only file you need to edit is test_main.cpp in the test_main Project.

The header files for the libraries are in the headers directory.  You should not need
to modify these.  If you want to add capabilities, add them in test_main.cpp.  The
files will be added to the libraries later.

As written, the options are:

0 - some basic plots - sin(th), cos(3 th) and tan(3 th) limited to +/- 2

1 - an interpolation exercise - provided with a set of data, it asks the user for x
values, using them for linear interpolation.  When a value outside the range of x's
is entered (like 0) it plots a spline fit to the data.
